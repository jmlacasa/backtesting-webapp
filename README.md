# Pyshiny Playground

This repo is a collection of web applications built with Shiny for Python. It is where I store hands-on webapps I built while learning and exploring the capabilities of the PyShiny framework through practical examples.

Each directory contains a standalone PyShiny app, including source code and necessary data files, covering a wide range of functionalities from basic to advanced features.

Feel free to use these examples as a starting point for your own projects!
If something comes out of it I would love to know about it and learn!
